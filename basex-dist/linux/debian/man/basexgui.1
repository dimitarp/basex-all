.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbasexgui\fP starts a standalone locally running instance of the BaseX database system.
.PP
In addition to the main database functionality of \fBbasex\fP(1), the graphical mode offers innovative graphical frontends to visualize XML data.
An advanced embedded XQuery Editor is coupled to the visualizations, providing instant result feedback.
.PP
XML and XQuery files can be passed on as parameters. If an XML \fIfile\fP is passed, a database instance is created from this \fIfile\fP. If an XQuery \fIfile\fP is passed on, it is opened in the XQuery editor.
