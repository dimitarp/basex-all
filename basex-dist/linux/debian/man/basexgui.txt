NAME
  basexgui - XML database system and XPath/XQuery processor (graphical mode)

SYNOPSIS
  basexgui [file]

DESCRIPTION
  basexgui starts a standalone locally running instance of the BaseX database system.

  In addition to the main database functionality of basex(1), the graphical mode offers innovative graphical frontends to visualize XML data.
  An advanced embedded XQuery Editor is coupled to the visualizations, providing instant result feedback.

  XML and XQuery files can be passed on as parameters. If an XML file is passed, a database instance is created from this file. If an XQuery file is passed on, it is opened in the XQuery editor.
